Abstract

The timing of the lockdown implementation is crucial for controlling the COVID-19 disease. Still, the estimation of its optimal value remains unknown. Here we determine the critical point prior of which lockdown could be imposed in order to shorten the epidemic duration and minimize deaths. Employing evidence from 24 European countries we show that the first wave of COVID-19 could be controlled if a lockdown was imposed at or before the cumulative deaths exceeded two people per million. In this case, the number of deaths at the peak of the epidemic is reduced by 87.75% and at the end stage by 86.64%. Furthermore, the duration from the first death to the epidemic peak is shortened by ten days. We also show that the cumulative number of deaths at the epidemic peak increases by 18.35% for every day that the lockdown is delayed past this critical point. These findings suggest that COVID-19 could be controlled if lockdown is imposed before cumulative deaths reach 2/1,000,000 persons, resulting in shorter epidemic durations, lower peaks, and total deaths. These findings can be used as guidelines assisting policymakers decide how best to implement a lockdown during an epidemic outbreak or rebound.
